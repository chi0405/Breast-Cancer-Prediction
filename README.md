## 1. About the Project
Breast cancer is a prevalent cancer among women worldwide, constituting 25% of all cancer cases. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques, to classify breast tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The analysis is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset obtained.

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset includes features derived from breast tumor biopsies, and the challenge is to accurately classify tumors as malignant or benign based on these features. The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle.

<a id="3-evaluation-metrics"></a>
## 3. Evaluation Metrics
The project evaluates the models based on standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
